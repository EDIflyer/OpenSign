# Why am I getting 'Ensure this field is accurately filled and meets all requirements'?
This happens when you leave a field blank or when you donâ€™t enter correct values in the field, for example not entering email address in correct format. 
At OpenSign we constantly try to improve the user experience our platform offers, in the latest version of OpenSign the field for which the validation has failed is automatically highlighted making it easy to identify & fix the incorrect values being entered.
You can check the bookmark icons on the page previews on the left hand side to quickly find all the pages that have fields meant to be filled by you.
