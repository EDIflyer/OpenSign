# Why is there no dropdown list when I sign a document myself?
The dropdown list field is available only when you request a signature from others or when you create a template. This is because dropdown lists function as temporary widgets, allowing the user to select one of multiple values. Once a signer selects a value from the dropdown, it is embedded into the document as text. When you sign a document yourself, OpenSign digitally signs it immediately upon clicking the finish button. Therefore, you can use the text widget to add the necessary text to the document.
