## Creating and Saving Your Signature

The drawing box on the left is dedicated to this purpose. If you make a mistake or wish to redo your signature, simply click the Clear button below the drawing box to erase it and start over.

## Uploading a Signature Image

Alternatively, if you prefer to use a pre-existing image of your signature, click the "Upload Image" button next to the Signature button. This will prompt you to select an image file from your device. Once uploaded, the image will be displayed in the drawing box, ready to be saved.

## Creating and Saving Your Initials

For creating your initials, use your mouse or a stylus to draw your initials on the drawing box on the right. As with the signature, there is a Clear button available to erase and redo the initials if necessary.

## Saving Your Signature and Initials

After you have drawn your signature and initials or uploaded your signature image, the next step is to save them. Click the Save button located below the drawing areas. This will store your signature and initials in the system, making them readily available for future use.

Once saved, these can be applied with a single click whenever you need to sign a document within the OpenSign application, streamlining your workflow and ensuring consistency in your document signing process.
